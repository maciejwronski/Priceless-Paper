# Priceless Paper

## General Info
First project, which I've made on third semester of my studies. It was based on Battle City Game for Pegasus ( For further information check https://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_City ),
but instead of tanks, there is a student, has 7 levels to complete, where each level is represented by other subject on studies, for example
on first level player has to fight with integrals.
